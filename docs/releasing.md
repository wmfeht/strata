# Releasing

Strata publishes signed, attested Linux binaries through the **Release** GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). This is the maintainer runbook for cutting a release, plus the tag grammar the self-updater depends on.

## Tag grammar

Exactly these forms are valid release tags. The self-updater rejects anything else outright, since this is the only contract it parses:

| Form | Example | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `v?MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` | `v0.5.0` | A final, stable release. |
| `v?MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-alpha.N` | `v0.5.0-alpha.1` | An alpha build. |
| `v?MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-beta.N` | `v0.5.0-beta.1` | A beta build. |
| `v?MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-rc.N` | `v0.5.0-rc.1` | A release candidate. |
| `v?MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-nightly.YYYYMMDD[.N]` | `v0.5.0-nightly.20260901` | A nightly build dated `YYYYMMDD`, with an optional same-day disambiguator. |

`N` is always a positive integer and is compared numerically. The leading `v` is optional in the parser but always present in published tags. At an equal core version, builds order as `nightly < alpha < beta < rc < stable`.

The in-app **Preview** channel receives alpha, beta, RC, and stable releases. The **Nightly** channel additionally receives nightly builds. All prerelease kinds, including nightlies, are published manually through the Release workflow.

## Archive notes for the next GitHub release

The first release that ships the libarchive backend should mention these
user-facing changes in the GitHub release body (they are intentional; see
[Architecture: Archives](architecture.md)):

- Creating password-protected ZIP (AES-256) and 7z is no longer offered.
  libarchive cannot write encrypted archives.
- Extracting encrypted 7z fails with “This archive is encrypted in a format
  that cannot be opened” instead of prompting. Encrypted ZIP (ZipCrypto and
  WinZip AES-256, including archives created by earlier Strata versions) still
  prompts for a password.

## Publishing a stable release

Run the **Release** workflow from GitHub's Actions tab on the default branch, choose a `bump` (`patch`, `minor`, or `major`), and leave `mode` at its default, `stable`. Once both Linux targets build:

- the `prepare` job refuses to proceed if a release candidate tag exists for the target core version whose commit is not yet reachable from the release source -- promote or discard that RC first, so a stable release can never silently supersede an untested one;
- the `release` job commits the new version into `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`, tags the commit `vX.Y.Z`, and pushes both to the default branch; and
- it publishes x86-64 and ARM64 archives, matching debug-symbol files, checksums, and build-provenance attestations as an ordinary (non-prerelease) GitHub release -- the endpoint a Stable install polls.

## Cutting and promoting prereleases

Run the same workflow manually with `mode` set to `alpha`, `beta`, `rc`, or `nightly`. For a prerelease, the optional `source` input accepts a pull-request number, branch, tag, or commit; leaving it blank uses the current default-branch tip. The workflow:

- resolves and records the exact source commit before building;
- computes the next core version from `bump`;
- gives alpha, beta, and RC builds the next numeric ordinal for their stage;
- gives nightlies a UTC-dated suffix, adding `.N` for repeated same-day runs;
- never touches `Cargo.toml` or `Cargo.lock`, and never pushes a version commit -- it tags the source commit directly;
- injects the exact tag and build kind at compile time; and
- publishes a GitHub prerelease, keeping `/releases/latest` pointed at the last stable release.

RC and nightly publication are intentionally manual. To promote a validated RC line to stable, run the workflow again with `mode: stable` and the same `bump` level. The resulting stable tag supersedes the prerelease line; the guard blocks promotion when an RC commit is not reachable from the stable source.

## Debugging a release build

Each release includes a `strata-VERSION-TARGET.debug` file matching its stripped binary. Download the debug file for the installed version and architecture, place it beside the `strata` binary, then run `coredumpctl debug strata`; GDB follows the binary's embedded debug link to load Rust function names and source lines.

## Version calculation

The version arithmetic described above is implemented in [`scripts/release_version.py`](../scripts/release_version.py), extracted out of the workflow (it was previously an inline heredoc) so it can be unit tested. Run its tests with:

```bash
python3 scripts/test_release_version.py
```

or the way CI runs every script test in the repo:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py'
```

Cases covered:

| Case | Input | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stable patch bump | `0.5.0`, `patch`, `stable`, no tags | `0.5.1` |
| Stable minor bump | `0.5.7`, `minor`, `stable`, no tags | `0.6.0` |
| Stable major bump | `0.5.7`, `major`, `stable`, no tags | `1.0.0` |
| Stable tag collision | `0.5.0`, `patch`, `stable`, tags include `v0.5.1` | rejected |
| First alpha for a core | `0.5.0`, `patch`, `alpha`, no tags | `0.5.1-alpha.1` |
| First beta for a core | `0.5.0`, `patch`, `beta`, no tags | `0.5.1-beta.1` |
| First RC for a core with no existing RC tags | `0.5.0`, `patch`, `rc`, no tags | `0.5.1-rc.1` |
| RC after an existing RC | `0.5.0`, `patch`, `rc`, tags include `v0.5.1-rc.1` | `0.5.1-rc.2` |
| RC ordinal is numeric, not lexicographic | `0.5.0`, `patch`, `rc`, tags include `v0.5.1-rc.1` .. `v0.5.1-rc.10` | `0.5.1-rc.11` |
| RC tag collision (defense in depth) | computed tag already present | rejected |
| First nightly for a date | `0.7.0`, `minor`, `nightly`, date `20260904` | `0.8.0-nightly.20260904` |
| Repeated same-day nightly | tags end at `v0.8.0-nightly.20260904.2` | `0.8.0-nightly.20260904.3` |
| Invalid nightly calendar date | date `20260230` | rejected |
| Unrelated tags ignored | tags for other cores or build kinds mixed in | ignored |

## Known limitation

This repository has no workflow test harness. The version-calculation logic above is unit tested; the workflow's job wiring, environment plumbing, and git/`gh` interactions are verified only by manual dry runs of the underlying shell logic against this repository's real `Cargo.toml` and tags, not by an actual GitHub Actions run.
